# Task
## Description
We are going to make a news feed that merges articles from 2 different sources and outputs it as JSON. The first source is a file you can find in `./resources/file-source.json`. The second one is an existing API located here: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/patrickreck/news-feed-output/articles. 

It's a small project, but pretend that it's a large one with many developers working on it. Follow general best practices and write testable code.

The task is complete when you have a HTTP endpoint and a command line command that outputs the articles from both sources in the format specified in `./resources/output.example.json` along with a unit test proving it works. 

## Requirements
* Use Laravel to implement the task
